> **AiLumi** (meaning "Light") is an empathetic AI companion designed to provide immediate mental wellness support, grounding techniques, and emotional clarity.

## 📖 Overview

In a fast-paced world, access to immediate mental health support is often limited. **AiLumi** bridges this gap by offering a supportive, non-judgmental space for users to express their feelings.

Built with **Google's Gemini API**, Lumi is capable of understanding context, detecting language (English/Malay), and providing actionable advice for anxiety, burnout, sleep issues, and stress management.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** *AiLumi is an AI support tool, not a replacement for professional medical help. Crisis protocols are hardcoded to direct users to emergency services if severe danger is detected.*

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎨 User-Centric Design
* **Calm "Lumi Light" UI:** Designed with a soft, warm color palette (Sky Blue & Warm Yellow) to reduce visual stress.
* **Dynamic Quick Actions:** Suggested responses change based on the conversation topic (e.g., if you mention "sleep," the buttons update to sleep-related tips).
* **Mobile Optimized:** Fully responsive design with touch-friendly controls for users on the go.
